# SamKnows Data Analyst Technical Test

Thanks for your application. Here's a short technical test before your interview.

Based on feedback from other people who have taken it, we think that this test will take between an hour and a few hours. Please take as much time as you need to complete your response, but don't spend an unreasonable amount of time on it. If you don't finish everything in time, then just send back what you have been able to do with commentary on how you would approach the remainder. If you find yourself short on time, please skip the `optional` parts.
